Checks the user's IP against a DB and if there was an entry of the IP in the DB, return true.

Originally used in an environment for a VPN site - to show their users were secure.


Make sure to edit the file to reflect your SQL setup.
You need a MySQL DB called "ipdb" (or you can edit the file and make it whatever you want), a table in that called "iptable" and at least one IP row in that.

May or may not work without adaptation - sensitive info had to be removed from the original file.
